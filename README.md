# 🚀 VeriPol.AI : AI-Powered Automated Insurance Claims Processing

## 📌 Problem Statement

Insurance claim processing is often time-consuming, requires manual verification of policies, and can cause delays in approvals. Customers frequently struggle to understand the terms of their insurance policies, leading to invalid or incomplete claims. Executives also spend significant time reviewing documents and validating claims, reducing operational efficiency. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically analyze claim requests, check them against policy rules, and provide instant, accurate feedback to both customers and staff.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an intelligent AI-powered system that:

- 🧠 **Assesses claims** for validity using NLP & LLMs  
- 💬 **Acts as a chatbot** to assist agents or customers in real-time  
- 📘 **Answers policy-related questions** based on membership handbooks  
- 📊 **Generates automated reports** for approvals, rejections, or fraud flags

---

## 🌍 Real-World Context

Traditional insurance claim processing involves manually verifying:

- Customer identity  
- Bills and invoices  
- Disease/treatment type  
- Insurance exclusions and limits  

VeriPol.AI transforms this process using:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand documents  
- **Embeddings & Vector Search** to match policies and bills semantically  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to reason and generate verdicts  
- **AI-Powered Reporting** to reduce approval times drastically

---

## 🧠 System Workflow

VeriPol AI operates in 4 major steps:

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & EDA

Automatically gathers and validates:

- Claimant details (personal info, medical history)  
- Previous claim records  
- Policy handbooks and hospital bills  

Then performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.

---

### 2️⃣ Embedding Generation

- Converts raw textual data into semantic embeddings  
- Enables intelligent matching against policy documents, disease exclusions, etc.

---

### 3️⃣ Query Execution & Report Generation

- Uses **LLMs (e.g., OpenAI/Gemini)** to evaluate the claim  
- Produces a **detailed claim assessment report** with explanations, reasoning, and suggested verdict

---

### 4️⃣ Parsing & Final Output

- Extracts actionable insights from LLM responses  
- Outputs a structured verdict including:  
  - ✅ Claim Validity  
  - 💰 Claimable Amount  
  - ❌ Rejection Reasons (if any)

---

## 📥 Key Inputs Required

- 📄 Insurance Handbook (PDF, Policy Terms)  
- 💳 Previous Claims and Medical Bills  
- 👤 Claimant Data (Name, Age, Condition)  
- 🏥 Medical Records with Diagnosis and Treatments
