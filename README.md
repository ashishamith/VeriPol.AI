# 🚀 VeriPol AI : AI-Powered Automated Insurance Claims Processing

## 📌 Problem Statement

Insurance claims processing is often **manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error**, which negatively impacts:

- ⏱ Turnaround Time  
- 💸 Operational Costs  
- 😞 Customer Satisfaction  
- ⚖️ Regulatory Compliance  

**VeriPol AI** aims to streamline and automate this workflow using Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an intelligent AI-powered system that:

- 🧠 **Assesses claims** for validity using NLP & LLMs  
- 💬 **Acts as a chatbot** to assist agents or customers in real-time  
- 📘 **Answers policy-related questions** based on membership handbooks  
- 📊 **Generates automated reports** for approvals, rejections, or fraud flags

---

## 🌍 Real-World Context

Traditional insurance claim processing involves manually verifying:

- Customer identity  
- Bills and invoices  
- Disease/treatment type  
- Insurance exclusions and limits  

VeriPol AI transforms this process using:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand documents  
- **Embeddings & Vector Search** to match policies and bills semantically  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to reason and generate verdicts  
- **AI-Powered Reporting** to reduce approval times drastically

---

## 🧠 System Workflow

VeriPol AI operates in 4 major steps:

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & EDA

Automatically gathers and validates:

- Claimant details (personal info, medical history)  
- Previous claim records  
- Policy handbooks and hospital bills  

Then performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.

---

### 2️⃣ Embedding Generation

- Converts raw textual data into semantic embeddings  
- Enables intelligent matching against policy documents, disease exclusions, etc.

---

### 3️⃣ Query Execution & Report Generation

- Uses **LLMs (e.g., OpenAI/Gemini)** to evaluate the claim  
- Produces a **detailed claim assessment report** with explanations, reasoning, and suggested verdict

---

### 4️⃣ Parsing & Final Output

- Extracts actionable insights from LLM responses  
- Outputs a structured verdict including:  
  - ✅ Claim Validity  
  - 💰 Claimable Amount  
  - ❌ Rejection Reasons (if any)

---

## 📥 Key Inputs Required

- 📄 Insurance Handbook (PDF, Policy Terms)  
- 💳 Previous Claims and Medical Bills  
- 👤 Claimant Data (Name, Age, Condition)  
- 🏥 Medical Records with Diagnosis and Treatments
